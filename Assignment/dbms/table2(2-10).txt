CREATE TABLE Employee (
    Employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(20),
    marks INT,
    last_name VARCHAR(20),
    salary INT,
    joining_date TIMESTAMP,
    department VARCHAR(20)
);

CREATE TABLE IncentiveTable (
    Employee_ref_date INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    Incentive_date TIMESTAMP, 
    Incentive_amount INT
);

3. Get First_Name from Employee table using "Tom" as the Employee Name

SELECT first_name
FROM Employee
WHERE first_name = 'Tom';

 4. Get FIRST_NAME, Joining Date, and Salary from Employee table

SELECT first_name, joining_date, salary
FROM Employee;

 5. Get all employee details from the Employee table ordered by First_Name Ascending and Salary Descending

SELECT *
FROM Employee
ORDER BY first_name ASC, salary DESC;

 6. Get employee details from the Employee table whose first name contains 'J'

SELECT *
FROM Employee
WHERE first_name LIKE '%J%';

7. Get department-wise maximum salary from Employee table ordered by department and salary ascending

SELECT department, MAX(salary) AS max_salary
FROM Employee
GROUP BY department
ORDER BY department ASC, max_salary ASC;

 9. Select first_name and incentive amount from Employee and IncentiveTable for those employees who have incentives and incentive amount greater than 3000

SELECT E.first_name, I.Incentive_amount
FROM Employee E
INNER JOIN IncentiveTable I
ON E.Employee_id = I.Employee_ref_date
WHERE I.Incentive_amount > 3000;

10. Create After Insert trigger on Employee table to insert records into viewtable

CREATE TABLE viewtable (
    Employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(20),
    last_name VARCHAR(20),
    salary INT,
    joining_date TIMESTAMP,
    department VARCHAR(20)
);

DELIMITER //

CREATE TRIGGER after_employee_insert
AFTER INSERT ON Employee
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO viewtable (Employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary, joining_date, department)
    VALUES (NEW.Employee_id, NEW.first_name, NEW.last_name, NEW.salary, NEW.joining_date, NEW.department);
END//
